# Hi there, I'm Luca! ðŸ‘‹

### I'm an aspiring junior web developer, passionate about technology :computer: and always eager to learn something new:student: about it! 
<br>

## About me :boy:
<br>

:man_teacher: **Iâ€™m currently learning and improving my skills on TommorrowDevs!**<br>
It' a community of **mentor developers** to support you to reach your goals as developer! Here I've found a lot of **challenging projects** and things to learn, always by doing with the tools as used in a real working environment (**time tracking**, **agile methodology** with deadlines, **trello and github project board**)!
<br>
<br>

:briefcase: **Iâ€™m currently working on an Team webapp as Frontend-developer! it's a webapp for image recognition still in progress!** [TeamProject](https://github.com/isabel-lombardi/fe_cat_photo)
<br>

You can learn a lot about yourself and your code **working with others** like:
- be **clear as possibile**	:policeman: about your code (the others must understand what you've done!);
- **communicate**:speaking_head: with your team members: if there's any problem and you're stucked;
- **ask for help**:pray: when you don't know how to do something or you're stucked;
- how to use **git**: feature-branch and pull request/code review approach;

<br>

## Soft Skills
- team working;
- problem solving;
